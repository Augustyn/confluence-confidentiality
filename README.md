# confluence-confidentiality

This is a Confluence plugin that provides a confidentiality setting for each page.

# What's inside

Here are the SDK commands you'll use immediately:

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-cli   -- after atlas-run or atlas-debug, opens a Maven command line window:
                 - 'pi' reinstalls the plugin into the running product instance
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK

# Whishlist

- [X] Improve style of confidentiality selector
- [ ] Full i18n (currently all confidentiality strings are not translated on the client side)
- [ ] Client code independent of `possibleConfidentialities` (so that the server entirely defines the set of possible confidentiality levels entirely)
- [ ] Admin UI (add/remove/rename possible confidentiality levels and change default confidentiality level)
- [ ] Optional per-space confidentiality set / default confidentiality
- [X] Editing of the confidentiality tied to the edit preferences of the page
- [ ] Change of confidentiality only possible within the editor
- [ ] Chosen confidentiality has impact on user roles (e.g. that certain roles can't see 'Confidential' pages or can only see 'Public' pages)

# Test the plugin locally

Run Confluence locally in Fastmodeâ„¢: `atlas-run --jvmargs "-Xmx4g -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=4g"`

Compile the project: `atlas-mvn package` (the local Confluence will automatically reload the code)

Confluence locally runs on port 1990: `http://localhost:1990/confluence/`

Use `admin:admin` as login.

# How to cut a release

1. Change the version in pom.xml to `X.Y.Z`
2. `atlas-mvn clean package` (or `mvn clean package` if you don't have [Atlassian's tools](https://developer.atlassian.com/docs/getting-started/set-up-the-atlassian-plugin-sdk-and-build-a-project) installed)
3. Test the package
4. Run `export VERSION=X.Y.Z; git add pom.xml && git commit -m "Version ${VERSION}" && git tag "v${VERSION}"`
5. Change the version in pom.xml to `X.Y.z-SNAPSHOT`, where `z=Z+1`
6. Run `git add pom.xml && git commit -m "Preparing for X.Y.z"`
7. Don't forget to `git push --tags origin`

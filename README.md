# confluence-confidentiality

This is a Confluence plugin that provides a confidentiality setting for each page.

# Space confidentiality configuration
By default plugin is not enabled for any space.
One have to enable it by going to either: Space Tools -> Addons, or Space menu -> Confidentiality

![Space menu](space_menu.png)

Option is visible only for space admin.

Space confidentiality options can be set after enabling confidentiality for space:

### Storing confidentiality options
Space confidentiality options are displayed as capitalized by default. 

Confidentiality options can be written either case, but in the process of normalization all letters will be converted to lowercase.
Due the way the confidentiality are stored by confluence, signs: # and , will be removed.

All confidentiality options length cannot exceed 322768 signs (with # and , as fields separators), it's confluence restriction.

# What's inside

Here are the SDK commands you'll use immediately:

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-cli   -- after atlas-run or atlas-debug, opens a Maven command line window:
                 - 'pi' reinstalls the plugin into the running product instance
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK

# Whishlist

- [X] Improve style of confidentiality selector
- [ ] Full i18n (currently all confidentiality strings are not translated on the client side)
- [X] Client code independent of `possibleConfidentialities` (so that the server entirely defines the set of possible confidentiality levels entirely)
- [ ] Admin UI (add/remove/rename possible confidentiality levels and change default confidentiality level)
- [X] Optional per-space confidentiality set / default confidentiality
- [X] Editing of the confidentiality tied to the edit preferences of the page
- [ ] Change of confidentiality only possible within the editor
- [ ] Chosen confidentiality has impact on user roles (e.g. that certain roles can't see 'Confidential' pages or can only see 'Public' pages)

# Test the plugin locally

Run Confluence locally in Fastmodeâ„¢: `atlas-run --jvmargs "-Xmx4g -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=4g"`

Compile the project: `atlas-mvn package` (the local Confluence will automatically reload the code)

Confluence locally runs on port 1990: `http://localhost:1990/confluence/`

Use `admin:admin` as login.

# How to cut a release

0. Make sure, you're on _*master*_.
1. Change the version in pom.xml to `X.Y.Z`
2. `atlas-mvn clean package` (You need to have [Atlassian's tools](https://developer.atlassian.com/docs/getting-started/set-up-the-atlassian-plugin-sdk-and-build-a-project) installed)
3. Test the package
4. Run `export VERSION=X.Y.Z; git add pom.xml && git commit -m "Version ${VERSION}" && git tag "v${VERSION}"`
5. Change the version in pom.xml to `X.Y.z-SNAPSHOT`, where `z=Z+1`
6. Run `git add pom.xml && git commit -m "Preparing for X.Y.z"`
7. Don't forget to `git push --tags origin`
8. Upload the file `target/confluence-confidentiality-X.Y.Z.jar` to the [Github release page](https://github.com/ninech/confluence-confidentiality/releases).
